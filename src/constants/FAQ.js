    question: "Do you charge any fees for your services?",
    answer:
      "No, our services are completely free for you. We earn commissions from our trusted travel partners (hotels, airlines, tour operators, etc.), so you get expert planning and personalized recommendations at no extra cost compared to booking directly.",
  },

    question:
      "Why should I book through your agency instead of online booking sites?",
    answer:
      "We offer personalized advice, insider knowledge, access to exclusive deals & upgrades not always shown online, 24/7 support in case of issues, and help with complex itineraries. If something goes wrong, you have a real person advocating for you — something most online platforms don't provide.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What documents do I need for international travel?",
    answer:
      "Requirements vary by destination and nationality. Generally you'll need a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date, possibly a visa, and sometimes proof of onward travel or vaccinations. We check the latest entry requirements for your specific itinerary and guide you through the process.",

    question: "Is travel insurance necessary and do you offer it?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we strongly recommend travel insurance for trip cancellation, medical emergencies, lost baggage, and travel delays. We partner with reputable providers and can include suitable coverage in your package, usually at very competitive rates.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is your cancellation and refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Policies depend on the specific tour, airline, hotel, or cruise line. We clearly outline cancellation terms (including any non-refundable deposits) before you book. In most cases, travel insurance can protect non-refundable portions. We assist with claims and changes whenever possible.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How far in advance should I book my trip?",
    answer:
      "For peak seasons and popular destinations (e.g., Europe summer, Maldives, Japan cherry blossoms), book 6–12 months ahead. For shoulder/low seasons or last-minute deals, 2–4 months can work well. The earlier you book, the better availability and pricing we can secure.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I make changes to my booking after it's confirmed?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in most cases — but changes may incur fees from suppliers (airlines/hotels/tours). The earlier you notify us, the better chance we have of making adjustments with minimal or no cost. We handle all changes for you and keep you updated.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What happens if my flight gets cancelled or delayed?",
    answer:
      "We monitor your flights and proactively assist with rebooking, hotel arrangements, or compensation claims when disruptions occur. Our team is available 24/7 for emergencies, and we use our supplier relationships to resolve issues faster than most self-booked travelers can.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Do you offer customized or tailor-made itineraries?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! We specialize in bespoke travel — whether it's a honeymoon, family adventure, solo journey, luxury escape, or multi-country trip. Tell us your preferences, budget, and interests, and we'll create a completely personalized itinerary.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "How do payments work and what payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "We offer flexible payment plans (installments when available from suppliers). You can pay by bank transfer, credit/debit card, or other secure methods. A deposit is usually required to secure your booking, with the balance due 30–90 days before departure (varies by product). All payments are secure and protected under relevant travel regulations.",
